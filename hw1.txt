Problem 4;
Calling func1(mat,3,4) begins to update the original values in the double array mat.
Running through the first for loop (i = 0) and all through the nested for loop results 
in the original values of mat (1, 2, 3, 4) because mat[0] was unchanged due to the base 
case in func1 that once n = 0 return mat[0][0]; However when n = 3 and 2, Func2 would change the first values of 
mat to the previous four terms added together. ie 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 (four terms before mat[1][0]) = 10 = mat[1][0] 
and 10 + 6 + 7 + 8 (four terms before mat [2][0] = 31. 
Problem 4 only changed mat[1][0] and mat [2][0] because of the line mat [n-1][0] = func1(mat, n-1, m)
The output then procedes to print out mat[i][j] where 0 <=i <3 and 0<= j < 4.
Output
 1   2   3   4
10   6   7   8
31  10  11  12
